Dear customer,


Please read the following notices concerning the memory VHDL model
you have received.


INSTALLATION:
============

Each VHDL model consists of 3 parts:
 *  a common package file for all memories of the same type
 *  a configuration specific VHDL code (VITAL95 compatible)
    for simulation
 *  one file with a component declaration

In addition a black box description for Place & Route of the
memory block is distributed.
 *  <name>.fpr   tool independent ASCII format
 *  <name>.lef   LEF file for Cadence Silicon Ensemble

packages are available for single port RAM, dual port RAM and ROM.
The package file have the naming convention "<name>_pkg.vhd"
and VHDL code of the configuration specific model "<name>.vhd".

Please compile the package first into a library named "work" and
as a second step compile the configuration specific code.

Note:
-----
Running the VHDL models of memories requires the following 
VHDL libaries, which are normally installed within the VHDL
simulator environment.
                    IEEE.std_logic_1164
                    IEEE.std_logic_arith
                    IEEE.VITAL_TIMING


TIMING MODELS:
==============

The VHDL code of a memory contains typical intrinsic delay and
setup/hold data. The timing data do not contain input slope/
output load delay calculations.

Therefore a "tlf" for Cadence Delay Calulator or Cadence PEARL is
added to this shipment. In the Delay Calculator exact timing data 
in dependeny of input slope/output load and temp/volt./process derating
can be calculted for your design, the delay data are stored in a SDF file.
This SDF file can be annotated into the VHDL model you have received.

The SDF file can be generated also with Synopsys DEsign Analyzer. 
Pleae refer also to the README file for the Synopsys model.

Please refer also to our design flow documentation.


The timing data in the VHDL model and "tlf" file are vaild only for
one nominal supply voltage 3.3V !
3.3V models can be combined with the dig. Std. cell library "csd".


ROM DATA INSERTION:
===================

ROM memory data are specified in a seperated file, located outside
the simulation model.
    
The ROM data format is:

                       00000000    -- first address
                       00000001
                       00000011
                       00000111
                       ....
                       00001111
                       00011110
                       00111100   -- last address
                       |      |
                       |      |
                      MSB    LSB


In the VHDL model there is a "DATA_FILE" variable defined, where this
romdata file is noticed to the VHDL model.
